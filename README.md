# Java Deep Dive: Object Oriented Programming

### Pre-requisites:
1. Java: https://www.java.com/en/download
2. Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer
    * Select your operating system under "Download"
    * Select "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"
    
### Choose your own adventure: 
- **Option A:** Choose this option if you'd like to look at the code that I use in the videos, and complete the exercises, but you plan to toss it away afterwards.
- **Option B:** If you'd like to commit your solutions back to GitHub, to add to your own portfolio of work, choose this option. 

### [Option A] To get the code running in Eclipse:
1. Click on the ![download](https://github.com/joonspoon/madecraft-oop/blob/master/doc/download.png) button above, then "Download ZIP".
2. Unpack the zip file on your computer. This will create a folder called madecraft-oop-master.
3. From Eclipse, click File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace > Next > Browse... and select the  **madecraft-oop-master** directory.

### [Option B] To get your own copy of the code:
0. Extra pre-requisite: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
1. Click on the ![fork](https://github.com/joonspoon/madecraft-oop/blob/master/doc/git%20fork%20button.png) button above. This repository will be copied into your user account.
2. From your command line ("Terminal" on Mac, "Command Prompt" in Windows), navigate into your `eclipse-workspace` directory.
3. Copy the repository URL from the address bar at the top of this page, and type: **`git clone [paste-your-repository-url]`**
4. From Eclipse, click File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace > Next > Browse... and select the  **madecraft-oop** directory.
5. When you're ready to upload your changes back to GitHub, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POGzh6epq7A) will show you how.

### [Option C]
